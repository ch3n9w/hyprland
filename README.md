## about keybinding

There are three kind of scenarios hungry for keybindings, to make them reasonable and while not conflict with each other, it's necessary to assign with different main mod keys or make the keybindings not conflict with same main mod key.

| main mod key |      other keys mainly used       |            scenario             |
